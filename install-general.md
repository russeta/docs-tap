# Installing part I: prerequisites, EULA, and CLI

This document describes the first part of the installation process for Tanzu Application Platform:

+ [Prerequisites](#prereqs)
+ [Accept the EULAs](#eulas)
+ [Install Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu](#tanzu-cluster-essentials)
+ [Install or Update the Tanzu CLI and Plugins](#cli-and-plugin)


## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

The following are required to install Tanzu Application Platform:

### Tanzu Network and container image registry requirements

Installation requires:

* A [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/) account to download
Tanzu Application Platform packages.

* A container image registry, such as [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) or
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) with at least **10&nbsp;GB** of available storage for
application images, base images, and runtime dependencies.
When available, VMware recommends using a paid registry account to avoid potential rate-limiting associated with some free registry offerings.

* Registry credentials with push and write access made available to Tanzu Application Platform to
store images.

* Network access to https://registry.tanzu.vmware.com

* Network access to your chosen container image registry.

* Latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
Tanzu Application Platform GUI currently does not support Safari browser.

#### Tanzu Application Platform GUI

- Git repository for the Tanzu Application Platform GUI's software catalogs, along with a token allowing read access.
  Supported Git infrastructure includes:
    - GitHub
    - GitLab
    - Azure DevOps
- Tanzu Application Platform GUI Blank Catalog from the Tanzu Application section of Tanzu Network
  - To install this, navigate to [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/) and select the Tanzu Application Platform. Under the list of available files to download, there will be a folder titled `tap-gui-catalogs`. Inside that folder is a compressed archive titled `Tanzu Application Platform Blank Catalog`. You'll need to extract that catalog to the preceding Git repository of choice. This serves as the configuration location for your Organization's Catalog inside Tanzu Application Platform GUI.
  - The Tanzu Application Platform GUI catalog allows for two approaches towards storing catalog information:
    - The default option uses an in-memory database and is suitable for test and development scenarios.
          This reads the catalog data from Git URLs that you specify in the `tap-values.yml` file.
          This data is ephemeral and any operations that cause the `server` pod in the `tap-gui` namespace to be re-created
          also cause this data to be rebuilt from the Git location.
          This can cause issues when you manually register entities through the UI because
          they only exist in the database and are lost when that in-memory database gets rebuilt.
    - For production use-cases, use a PostgreSQL database that exists outside the Tanzu Application Platform's packaging.
          This stores all the catalog data persistently both from the Git locations and from the GUI's manual entity registrations.
- Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that can be pointed at the `tanzu-shared-ingress` service.
The default host name consists of `tap-gui` plus an `IngressDomain` of your choice. For example,
`tap-gui.example.com`.

### Kubernetes cluster requirements
Installation requires:

* Kubernetes cluster v1.19 or later on one of the following Kubernetes providers:

    * Azure Kubernetes Service
    * Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
    * Google Kubernetes Engine
        * GKE Autopilot clusters do not have required features enabled
    * Kind
        * Supported only on Linux operating system.
        * Minimum requirements: 8 CPUs for i9 or equivalent, 12 CPUs for i7 or equivalent, 8 GB RAM (12+ GB recommended), and 120 GB disk space.
        * If you are using Cloud Native Runtimes, see [Configure Your Local Kind
        Cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cloud-Native-Runtimes-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.0/tanzu-cloud-native-runtimes-1-0/GUID-local-dns.html#config-cluster).
        * Because Kind doesn't support LoadBalancer, make sure to use NodePort when defining service types.

* Configure `hostPort` to `containerPort` mappings for ports 80 and 443 to enable access to the
cluster from your local machine. For example:

    ```
    kind: Cluster
    apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
    nodes:
    - role: control-plane
    - role: worker
      extraPortMappings:
      - containerPort: 30443
        hostPort: 443
      - containerPort: 30080
        hostPort: 80
    ```

    * Minikube
        * Minimum requirements for VM: 8 CPUs for i9 or equivalent, 12 CPUs for i7 or equivalent, 8 GB RAM (12+ GB recommended), and 120 GB disk space.
        * VMware recommends at least 16 GB of total host memory.
        * On MacOS only Hyperkit driver is supported; Docker driver is not supported.
    * Tanzu Kubernetes Grid v1.4
        * Do not use a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid cluster that runs production workloads.
        * To install Tanzu Application Platform on Tanzu Kubernetes Grid v1.4,
          see [Installing with Tanzu Kubernetes Grid v1.4](install-tkg.md).
    * Tanzu Community Edition v0.9.1
        * Visit the Tanzu Community Edition installation page to follow installation instructions at [Tanzu Community Edition](install-tce.md)

### Resource requirements

* To deploy all Tanzu Application Platform packages, your cluster must have at least:
    * 8 GB of RAM across all nodes available to Tanzu Application Platform
    * 8 CPUs for i9 (or equivalent) available to Tanzu Application Platform components
    * 12 CPUs for i7 (or equivalent) available to Tanzu Application Platform components
    * 16 GB of RAM available to build and deploy applications, including for Kind and Minikube
    * 70 GB of disk space available per node

* For the [`full` profile](install.html#about-tanzu-application-platform-package-profiles-1), or
    use of Security Chain Security Tools - Store, your cluster must have a configured default StorageClass.

* [Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/)
must be configured so that Tanzu Application Platform controller pods can run as root.

### Tools and CLI requirements

Installation requires:

* The Kubernetes CLI, kubectl, v1.19, v1.20 or v1.21, installed and authenticated with administrator rights for your target cluster. See [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* To set the Kubernetes cluster context:

    1. List the existing contexts by running:

        ```
        kubectl config get-contexts
        ```

        For example:

        ```
        $ kubectl config get-contexts
        CURRENT   NAME                                CLUSTER           AUTHINFO                                NAMESPACE
                aks-repo-trial                      aks-repo-trial    clusterUser_aks-rg-01_aks-repo-trial
        *       aks-tap-cluster                     aks-tap-cluster   clusterUser_aks-rg-01_aks-tap-cluster
                tkg-mgmt-vc-admin@tkg-mgmt-vc       tkg-mgmt-vc       tkg-mgmt-vc-admin
                tkg-vc-antrea-admin@tkg-vc-antrea   tkg-vc-antrea     tkg-vc-antrea-admin
        ```

    2.  Set the context to the cluster that you want to use for the Tanzu Application Platform packages install.
        For example set the context to the `aks-tap-cluster` context by running:

        ```
        kubectl config use-context aks-tap-cluster
        ```

        For example:

        ```
        $ kubectl config use-context aks-tap-cluster
        Switched to context "aks-tap-cluster".
        ```

    Ensure that you have the `package`, `secret`, `accelerator`, `services`, and `apps` plugins.
    You need these plugins to install and interact with the Tanzu Application Platform.

    Tanzu Application Platform beta requires cluster-admin privileges.
    Running commands associated with the additional plugins can have unintended side-effects.
    VMware recommends against running `cluster`, `kubernetes-release`, `login`, `management-cluster`,
    and `pinniped-auth` commands.

You can now proceed with installing Tanzu Application Platform. For more information, see
**[Installing part II: Profiles](install.md)**.


## <a id='udpate-previous-tap-tanzu-cli'></a>Instructions for updating Tanzu CLI that was installed for a previous release of Tanzu Application Platform

## <a id='udpate-tkg-tce-tanzu-cli'></a>Instructions for updating Tanzu CLI previously installed for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid or Tanzu Community Edition

Follow these instructions to update the Tanzu CLI previously installed for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid or Tanzu Community Edition:

- If your Tanzu CLI version is **greater or equal to `v0.11.0`**, you must [delete your existing Tanzu CLI, plug-ins, and associated files](uninstall.md#remove-tanzu-cli) and then perform a [clean install](#tanzu-cli-clean-install)
- If your Tanzu CLI version is **less than or equal to `v0.10.0`**, proceed to step 1.

  1. Create a directory named `tanzu`:

     ```
     mkdir $HOME/tanzu
     ```
     If `tanzu` already exists, delete the files in the directory.

  2. Sign in to [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com).

  3. Navigate to [Tanzu Application Platform](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-application-platform/)
on Tanzu Network.

  4. Click the **tanzu-cli-0.10.0** directory.

  5. Download the CLI bundle corresponding to your operating system. For example, if your client
operating system is Linux, download the `tanzu-framework-linux-amd64.tar` bundle.

  6. Unpack the TAR file in the `tanzu` directory by running:

     ```
     tar -xvf tanzu-framework-linux-amd64.tar -C $HOME/tanzu
     ```

  7. Navigate to the `tanzu` directory by running:

     ```
     cd $HOME/tanzu
     ```

  8. Set env var `TANZU_CLI_NO_INIT` to true to install the local plugin versions you've just downloaded:

     ```
     export TANZU_CLI_NO_INIT=true
     ```

  9. Check to see if the `imagepullsecret` and `package` plugins are already installed:

     ```
     tanzu plugin list
     ```

     If either is present present, delete them:

     ```
     tanzu plugin delete imagepullsecret
     ```

     And/Or

     ```
     tanzu plugin delete package
     ```

  10. Install the `secret` plugin by running:

      ```
      tanzu plugin install secret --local ./cli
      ```

  11. Install the `accelerator` plugin by running:

      ```
      tanzu plugin install accelerator --local ./cli
      ```

  12. Install the `apps` plugin by running:

      ```
      tanzu plugin install apps --local ./cli
      ```

  13. Install the updated `package` plugin by running:

      ```
      tanzu plugin install package --local ./cli
      ```


  14. Install the `services` plugin by running:

      ```
      tanzu plugin install services --local ./cli
      ```


  15. Verify that the Tanzu Application Platform plugins are present:

      ```
      tanzu plugin list
      ```

      Expect the following to be included in the list:
      ```
      tanzu plugin list

      package             v0.13.1         Tanzu package management                                           core        v0.10.0  installed
      secret              v0.13.1         Tanzu secret management                                            core        v0.10.0  installed
      services                            Discover Service Types and manage Service Instances (ALPHA)                    v0.1.1   installed
      ```
